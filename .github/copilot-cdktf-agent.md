# Copilot Agent â€“ CDKTF Instructions

When working with CDK for Terraform:
- Target Terraform v1.5.x compatibility.
- Use TypeScript constructs from the `cdktf` library.
- Always run `cdktf synth` to validate generated code.
- Ensure generated Terraform respects existing state and backend configuration.
- Provide examples of ` cdktf.Project` setup and common patterns.
